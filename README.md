Two sets of codes exist, the initial is a PCA based code that was trialled. PCA didn't give satisfactory results when used as a preprocessor due to the scarcity of datapoints.
The output from PCA was used to help with feature selection, however, by examining the vector composition of the vector components.
The second code shows the actual classifier implemented. The tester code evaluates the final performance of the classifier.
